## Bump is an educational resource guide dedicated to helping mothers make better-informed decisions regarding themselves and their baby â€“ not through informing, but by educating them. 

We strongly believe that improving maternal and child health will have a significant impact on overall global health, education and development. We are dedicated to normalizing the disparity of information given to women of different socioeconomic statuses and races. We provide annotated, easy-to-read resources in a personalized timeline for our users. 

_What we learned:_
For many members of our team, this was our first experience with web development. We learned how to build React components, style our webpages using CSS, and handle forms/navigation using JavaScript. 

_Future ideas:_
* Chat Bot: We would like to use a chat bot that handles frequently asked questions, connects mothers to healthcare professionals, and provides other physical/mental health support. 
* Forums: We would like to provide a safe place for mothers to discuss their experiences with pregnancy. This community will help new mothers and mothers with low education feel included and in control of their health. It would also have a verified feature for professionals to post answers with marked credibility.

This web app was written in ReactJS, JavaScript, and HTML for HackDuke: Code For Good 2019.
